Field Listing :: Current Health Expenditure :: The World Factbook

Current Health Expenditure (CHE) describes the share of spending on health in each country relative to the size of its economy.  It includes expenditures corresponding to the final consumption of health care goods and services and excludes investment, exports, and intermediate consumption.  CHE shows the importance of the health sector in the economy and indicates the priority given to health in monetary terms.  Note: Current Health Expenditure replaces the former Health Expenditures field and is calculated differently.
