| **Arctic Ocean** | the Arctic fishery region (Region 18)Â is the smallest in the world with a catch of only 52 mt in 2016, although the Food and Agriculture Organization assesses that some Arctic catches are reported in adjacent regions; Russia and Canada were historically the major producers; in 2017, the five littoral states including Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the US agreed to a 16 year ban on fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean to allow for time to study the ecological system of these waters |

| **Indian Ocean** | *the Indian Ocean fisheries are the third most important in the world accounting for 14%, or 11,318,783 mt of the global catch in 2016; tuna, small pelagic fish, and shrimp are important species in these regions; the Food and Agriculture Organization delineated two fishing regions in the Indian Ocean:* |
| | Eastern Indian Ocean region (Region 57) is the most important region and the fourth largest producing region in the world with 8%, or 6,387,659 mt, of the global catch in 2016; the region encompasses the waters north of 55Âº South latitude and east of 80Âº East longitude including the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea with the major producers including Indonesia (1,405,401 mt), India (1,382,504 mt), Burma (1,185,610 mt), Bangladesh (626,528mt), and Sri Lanka (445,842 mt); the principal catches include shad, Skipjack tuna, mackerel, shrimp, and sardinellas |
