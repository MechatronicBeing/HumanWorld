Field Listing :: Land use :: The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency

This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three different types of land use: agricultural land, forest, and other; agricultural land is further divided into arable land - land cultivated for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest, permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest, and includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, and permanent pastures and meadows â€“ land used for at least five years or more to grow herbaceous forage, either cultivated or growing naturally; forest area is land spanning more than 0.5 hectare with trees higher than five meters and a canopy cover of more than 10% to include windbreaks, shelterbelts, and corridors of trees greater than 0.5 hectare and at least 20 m wide; land classified as other includes built-up areas, roads and other transportation features, barren land, or wasteland.
